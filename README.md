# LogicForge

LogicForge is a simplified system that allows users to define, execute, and manage business rules and complex events in a declarative and efficient way. It provides a rule engine, a DMN engine, and a CEP engine that can handle various types of logic and data.

## Rule Engine

The rule engine component of LogicForge can evaluate and execute rules based on facts and data. It consists of a rule parser and a rule engine core.

### Rule Parser

The rule parser is a subcomponent that can parse rules written in a domain-specific language (DSL) and convert them into executable objects. It consists of a lexer, a parser, and a compiler.

### Rule Engine Core

The rule engine core is a subcomponent that can manage and execute the rules using a forward-chaining algorithm. It consists of a working memory, an agenda, a rule base, and an inference engine.

## DMN Engine

The DMN engine component of LogicForge can evaluate and execute decision models based on the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard. It consists of a DMN parser and a DMN engine core.

### DMN Parser

The DMN parser is a subcomponent that can parse decision models written in XML or JSON and convert them into executable objects. It consists of an XML/JSON reader, a model builder, and a model compiler.

### DMN Engine Core

The DMN engine core is a subcomponent that can manage and execute the decision models using a dependency graph algorithm. It consists of a context, a decision graph, a decision base, and an evaluation engine.

## CEP Engine

The CEP engine component of LogicForge can detect and respond to complex events based on streams of data. It consists of a CEP parser and a CEP engine core.

### CEP Parser

The CEP parser is a subcomponent that can parse complex event patterns written in a DSL and convert them into executable objects. It consists of a lexer, a parser, and a compiler.

### CEP Engine Core

The CEP engine core is a subcomponent that can manage and execute the complex event patterns using a pattern matching algorithm. It consists of an event buffer, a pattern matcher, and an action executor.
